# LiveFire MVP

This project is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for **LiveFire**, a high-performance logistics network for youth sports. The goal is to replace low-ROI practices with high-intensity "Joint Training" sessions.

## Core Objective

The immediate goal of this MVP is to create a single, shareable webpage that allows a coach to invite another team to a joint training session and capture their phone number as a lead.

## Target User

Our primary user is **"Coach Mike,"** a head coach who is on the field, likely with dirty thumbs, and needs a simple, fast, and effective way to upgrade his team's practice sessions.

## Key Principles

*   **Mobile First:** The experience must be flawless on a mobile device.
*   **Zero Friction:** No logins, no app downloads. The user interacts via a "Magic Link."
*   **Dark Mode:** The UI is designed for evening use under stadium floodlights.

This project is being developed with the assistance of an AI coding companion. Please see `docs/` and `blueprint.md` for the full project vision and technical specifications.
