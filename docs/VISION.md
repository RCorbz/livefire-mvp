# LiveFire | Project Vision & Constitution

## Core Philosophy
LiveFire is NOT a scheduling app. It is a **High-Performance Logistics Network**.
We do not sell "matches." We sell **"Game Speed."**
We are replacing mundane, low-ROI internal practices with high-intensity "Joint Training" sessions between rival clubs.

## The "North Star" Metrics
1. **Intensity:** Every interaction must feel "Live Fire" (Urgent, Tactical, High Stakes).
2. **Speed:** Zero friction. No login walls. No passwords. "Magic Links" only.
3. **Hyper-Local:** Focused entirely on Draper/Lehi, Utah (Zip 84020).

## Brand Identity
* **Name:** LiveFire
* **Voice:** Tactical, Professional, Direct, "Locker Room" (but elite).
* **Visuals:**
    * **Background:** Deep Dark Mode (Slate-900 or Black).
    * **Primary Text:** Stark White (#FFFFFF) for maximum readability.
    * **Accents/Icons:** Premium Gold (#FACC15 or Tailwind yellow-400). 
    * **Vibe:** "Under the Floodlights." High contrast. No grey text unless it's secondary metadata.
* **Anti-Patterns:**
    * No cartoons.
    * No "Soft" colors (Pastels).
    * No clutter.
    * We are not "TeamSnap" (Admin heavy).
    * We are not "Facebook Groups" (Chaotic).

## The "Trojan Horse" Strategy
We do not ask users to "Sign Up." We send them a value-add link (a Game Card). By interacting with the card (Accept/Decline), they unknowingly onboard into the network.
