# LiveFire | Project Vision & Constitution

## Core Philosophy
LiveFire is NOT a scheduling app. It is a **High-Performance Logistics Network**.
We do not sell "matches." We sell **"Game Speed."**
We are replacing mundane, low-ROI internal practices with high-intensity "Joint Training" sessions between rival clubs.

## The "North Star" Metrics
1. **Intensity:** Every interaction must feel "Live Fire" (Urgent, Tactical, High Stakes).
2. **Speed:** Zero friction. No login walls. No passwords. "Magic Links" only.
3. **Hyper-Local:** Focused entirely on Draper/Lehi, Utah (Zip 84020).

## Brand Identity
* **Name:** LiveFire
* **Voice:** Tactical, Professional, Direct, "Locker Room" (but elite).
* **Visuals:** Dark Mode, Burnt Orange (#FF4D00), High Contrast.
* **Anti-Patterns (What we are NOT):**
    * We are not "TeamSnap" (Admin heavy).
    * We are not "Facebook Groups" (Chaotic).
    * We do not use clip art or cartoons.

## The "Trojan Horse" Strategy
We do not ask users to "Sign Up." We send them a value-add link (a Game Card). By interacting with the card (Accept/Decline), they unknowingly onboard into the network.
